**(React + Redux + React Router + Redux Persist) * (Webpack + Babel) = Eutopia!!!**


A simple react boilerplate which consists of:
1. React
2. Redux
3. React Router
4. Redux Persist

It uses latest babel to transpile and webpack to bundle the code.

The kit contains two scripts:
1. NPM START which runs a development version using the webpack-server
2. NPM RUN BUILD which builds a production version, the script is made using the best tips and practices from the official webpack site, which makes sure the outputed production bundle has the minimal size!

To install run:
npm install
